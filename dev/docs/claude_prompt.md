I'm developing TSMIS. Here's the information in the project knowledge:  

1. technical.md  
2. dev_manual.md  
3. dev_roadmap
4. current_code.txt - updated and most recent code.
5. base_code.txt - Previous old non updated code.

We need to implement the system according to this technical and dev documentation. 
The base_code.txt we have is old code that needs to be refactored. 

Current state:
1. I have the folder set-up and server code. Review the 'current_code.txt' 
2. I have the core error, container system (w/ consolidated registry system), and module system implemented.
3. I Copied from old 'base_code.txt': * vite.config.js * jest.config.mjs * server.js * babel.config.js * .env * .gitignore * package.json * 

Please help me: 
1. Review Core/base Fundamentals existing system and it's core components
2. Review existing current_code.txt and folder structure Let me know first your proposal and recommendation after a thorough analysis and carefully review of the documentations in the project knowledge.
3. let me know what is the next step.
